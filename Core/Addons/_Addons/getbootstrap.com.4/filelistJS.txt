# To support sites that want full bootstrap or a specific version, a skin has to be created which uses Bootstrap. 
#
# The skin's filelistJS.txt would include bootstrap using 
# Uses YetaWF_Core,getbootstrap.com.4
# or
# Uses YetaWF_Core,getbootstrap.com.5
#
# The project.json file must include the desired bootstrap version:
#     "bootstrap": "^4.6.0",
# or
#     "bootstrap": "^5.0.2",
#
# Otherwise, Bootstrap is used (by skins) just for the grid/layout support. Bootstrap Components/JavaScript is NOT supported in a standard YetaWF install.
# In this case the compiled skin (scss) includes the relevant Bootstrap files and no other Bootstrap files (CSS,JS) are used (no other <link>s).
# Example of skin including bootstrap:
#
# // We're using bootstrap's reboot and grid only
# @import "node_modules/bootstrap4/scss/bootstrap-reboot";
# @import "node_modules/bootstrap4/scss/bootstrap-grid";
